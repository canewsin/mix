# Design Tokens

## Introduction

Design tokens are the core of any design system. They are the smallest pieces of a design system that define the visual properties of a UI. These properties can include colors, typography, spacing, and more. Design tokens are used to maintain consistency across an application and make it easier to update the design system. As Mix is a solution for styling and is used for building design systems, it also supports design tokens.

## Getting Started

Mix has built-in support for design tokens. It naturally integrates with five types of them: `color`, `textStyle`, `space`, `radius`, and `breakpoint`. These tokens are used to define the visual properties in key-value pairs, where the key is the token name and the value is the actual value of the token.

```dart {1,5}
final primary = ColorToken('primary');

final docTheme = MixThemeData(
  colors: {
    primary: Colors.lightBlue,
  },
  textStyles: {...},
  radii: {...},
  spaces: {...},
);
```

## MixTheme and MixThemeData

In the same way we use `Theme` and `ThemeData` in Flutter, Mix has `MixTheme` and `MixThemeData`. `MixTheme` is a widget that wraps the application and provides the design tokens to all its child widgets.

```dart {1,5}
MixTheme(
  data: docTheme,
  child: ...
);
```

### MixThemeData

`MixThemeData` is a class that defines the values for the design tokens that will be used throughout the application. It has five properties related to Design Tokens: `colors`, `textStyles`, `spaces`, `radii`, and `breakpoints`. Each property is a map that contains the tokens and their values.

```dart {1-4}
const primary = ColorToken('primary');
const h1 = TextStyleToken('h1');
const radiusMedium = RadiusToken('radiusMedium');
const spaceMedium = SpaceToken('spaceMedium');

final docTheme = MixThemeData(
  colors: {
    primary: Colors.lightBlue,
  },
  textStyles: {
    h1: const TextStyle(
      fontSize: 24,
      fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
    ),
  },
  radii: {
    radiusMedium: const Radius.circular(10),
  },
  spaces: {
    spaceMedium: 10,
  },
);
```

Also, `MixThemeData` has an additional property called `defaultOrderOfModifiers`, which is used to override the default order of modifiers. Therefore, if you prefer to use a different order of modifiers, you can set it in the `defaultOrderOfModifiers` instead of using the `orderOfModifiers` property in each `StyledWidget`. To set your own order of modifiers, you just need to pass a list of types that extends `WidgetModifierSpec`. For instance:

```dart
final docTheme = MixThemeData(

  // ...
  defaultOrderOfModifiers: const [
    SizedBoxModifierSpec,
    ClipRectModifierSpec,
    TransformModifierSpec,
  ],
);
```

### Dynamic Themes

Mix allows you to define dynamic themes, which means that the values of the design tokens can be resolved dynamically using a [BuildContext](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/BuildContext-class.html). To do this, you need to use the `ColorResolver`, `TextStyleResolver`, `RadiusResolver` and `BreakpointResolver` classes. These classes are used to resolve the values of the design tokens based on the current `BuildContext`.

As an example, let's say you want to define a `surface` color token that changes based on the platform brightness. You can do this by using the `ColorResolver` class:

```dart
final surface = ColorToken('surface');

final docTheme = MixThemeData(
  colors: {
    surface: ColorResolver((context) {
      if (MediaQuery.of(context).platformBrightness == Brightness.dark) {
        return Colors.black;
      }
      return Colors.white;
    }),
  },
);
```

## Applying design tokens

After defining the design tokens, you can use them in your application to style your widgets. All attributes that accept a token as a value have a `ref` method that allows you to access the token value. For instance:

```dart
$box.color.ref(ColorToken)

$text.style.ref(TextStyleToken)

$box.borderRadius.ref(RadiusToken)

$box.padding.all.ref(SpaceToken) // You can replace `all` with any other padding property
```

In a real example:

```dart
Box(
  style: Style(
    $box.color.ref(primary),
    $box.height(100),
    $box.width(100),
  ),
);
```

Mix's tokens are also flexible enough to be used in Flutter's widgets, you just need to use the `resolve` method to get the token value.

```dart
Container(
  height: 200,
  width: 200,
  color: primary.resolve(context),
)
```

## Next Steps

Now that you know how design tokens work in Mix, you can start defining your own tokens and using them in your application. For a step-by-step tutorial on how to theme your app with Mix, check the [Theming](/docs/tutorials/theming) guide.
